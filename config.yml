        Title: "Who am I"
        Content: >
          As a programmer with a passion for reading, I have dedicated the past five years to honing my skills in blockchain technology, initially working with permissioned chains and later transitioning to permissionless. 
          In my day-to-day life, I am captivated by books, particularly those that explore history and society. These works inspire me and offer valuable insights into historical events. 
          I created this website to share my thoughts and ideas, with the hope that they may prove helpful to others.
